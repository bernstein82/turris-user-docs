There is also difference with configuration router or computer. Router mode means that this devices manages the LAN (acts as a router, can assing IP addresses, ...). Computer mode means that this device acts as a client in this network. It acts in a similar way as WAN, but it has opened ports for configuration interface and other services.

If you need to chose more complicated options, we recommend to use interface LuCI.
