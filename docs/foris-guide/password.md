## Setting password

![Setting password without LuCI](foris-guide/pw.png)

You can set the password that will be used to access the Foris interface here. In the "Advanced" line you can choose if you want to set the same password with Foris or use another one. The same password will be used for the advanced configuration interface LuCI and for the user root when accessing the router via SSH.

In the first column, you can set up the desired password for administration interface Foris. In the second you need to repeat this password.

If you do not need to adjust any advanced functions, we recommend you not to set the password for LuCI and SSH until the time when you need it. (This password can be changed at any time in the future on the Advanced administration page.)

If you are finished with choosing your password, click on the blue button Save in the right bottom corner. After this will show up in the right upper corner button "Next step".
