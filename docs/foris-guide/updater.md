## Updater

You can activate or deactivate the automatic updates on Turris router. If the automatic updates are enabled, you can install lists of software packages using the Updater. These lists can simplify the installation of additional software which allows you to use more features such as turning your router into an NAS (network attached storage) or allows you to connect a printer to the router. The packages will be installed shortly after selecting the desired package lists and pressing the Save changes button.
