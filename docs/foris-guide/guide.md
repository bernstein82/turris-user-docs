# First setup | Foris Guide

Although a router is a device that does not need a permanent attention, it has to be configured before its first use. To make the configuration simpler, Turris router contains Foris web interface, which also contains an initial setup guide. Until you finish the basic router configuration, computers connected to the LAN ports won't be able to connect to the internet. \
In order to access Foris configuration interface, you need to be connected to the same network as the router. It is possible to use only cable connection during the first run â€“ WiFi network may be enabled later. \
If you would like to go through the first step how to set up your router, you need to go to http://192.168.1.1 where you can find our administration interface Foris and its Guide, which is described here.
